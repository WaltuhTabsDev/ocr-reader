OCRReader is an offline OCR Reader with 5 Langs with three levels and exporting feature. 
## How to use?
Just download the Built one , You can build it yourself but use a localhost
## Why doesn't it work when using it on a browser
It doesn't work when loading locally due to cros policy that's why it is better to use a localhost to use it to test or just build it, I used neutralino.js for this
## CSS
I used tacit for the css
